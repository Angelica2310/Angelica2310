Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate developer with a love for technology and coding. I enjoy building web applications that are both functional and user-friendly. My main areas of focus include React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.

ðŸš€ Technologies I'm Exploring
React: Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience in building dynamic and interactive user interfaces using React. I love how it allows for component-based architecture and makes building large applications easier and more maintainable.

Next.js: Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into Next.js to build server-side rendered React applications. It's an amazing tool for improving performance and SEO.

Tailwind CSS: Iâ€™m passionate about using Tailwind CSS to create beautiful, responsive UIs with minimal effort. I enjoy how its utility-first approach allows for faster development and greater control over the design.

ðŸ’¡ Projects
Iâ€™ve worked on several interesting projects, from simple landing pages to more complex full-stack applications. Here are a few highlights:

[3bay]: an e-commerce website built using modern technologies, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Clerk for authentication, Radix UI Primitives, Stripe for payments, React DOM, React
Redux, Lucide icons, and AWS services such as S3 buckets and API Gateway. The platform features dynamic pages that provide distinct functionalities for buyers and sellers. Buyers can explore products, add
items to their cart, and complete secure payments through Stripe. Sellers can create their own shops, add products and custom their shop, making it a comprehensive solution for both buyers and businesses.

[expense-tracker]: mini full-stack web application. This app is fully functional client using React and Express; contains dynamic pages using react-route-dom; retrieves information by
SQL from the database schema in Express server

[rating-system]: the website built using Next.js, Chart.js, and Clerk, offering real-time ratings and data visualization for favorite brand. Users can securely log in via Clerk, rate products, and instantly see their feedback reflected on the platform. The ratings are then visualized using interactive charts powered by Chart.js, which display trends and overall performance. Data is securely stored and retrieved through a database, making the site not only interactive but also dynamic and user-focused.

ðŸ“š Learning & Growth
As someone passionate about tech, Iâ€™m always looking to learn new things and improve my skills. Whether itâ€™s experimenting with new frameworks, building my own projects, or contributing to open-source, Iâ€™m committed to growing as a developer every day.
